  # call-seq:
  #     haversine(u, v) -> Float
  #
  # Compute accurate distances between two points given their latitudes and
  # longitudes, even for short distances. This isn't a distance measure in the
  # same sense as the other methods in +Measurable+.
  #
  # The distance returned is the great circle (or orthodromic) distance between
  # +u+ and +v+, which is the shortest distance between them on the surface of
  # a sphere. Thus, this implementation considers the Earth to be a sphere.
  #
  # Reminding that the input vectors are of the form [latitude, longitude] in
  # degrees, so if you have the coordinates [23 32' S, 46 37' W] (from SÃ£o
  # Paulo), the corresponding vector is [-23.53333, -46.61667].

  # * *Arguments* :
  #   - +u+ -> An array of Numeric objects.
  #   - +v+ -> An array of Numeric objects.
  #   - +unit+ -> (Optional) A Symbol representing the unit of measure. Available
  #               options are +:miles+, +:feet+, +:km+ and +:meters+.
  # * *Returns* :
  #   - The great circle distance between +u+ and +v+.
  # * *Raises* :
  #   - +ArgumentError+ -> The size of +u+ and +v+ must be 2.
  #   - +ArgumentError+ -> +unit+ must be a Symbol.
